    <h2>Favourite Foods</h2><p>Pizza, burgers, chicken, basically anything fried and unhealthy is probably high on my options. Just no onions or beans, and I mean <b>none</b>.</p>
    <h3>Favourite Games</h3><p>Colony Sims, strategy, rpg, idle, I enjoy a large variety of games. Most notable is probably Oxygen Not Included, a deceptively simple seeming colony sim that hides a complex emergent combination of systems that allow for complex constructions to achieve different aims. I've put many thousand hours into the game by this point and moderate a large community discord dedicated to it, where we do what we can to ameliorate the learning cliff new players experience when seeing the depth of the game.</p>
    <h4>Why I Joined Codenation</h4><p>I want to write code for a living. In an ideal world this would be freelance, writing what interests me and making a living off that, but realistically I'd be happy with a large range of positions.</p>
    <h5>My Targets</h5><ul><li>To get a foundation of confidence and skill at coding: I think I'm making strides here, though of course there's a good distance yet to go.</li>
    <li>Get a qualification that'll facilitate working from home: coding is a skillset that seems well suited to this, and I feel I'm doing well at it, so completing this course should tick this box nicely and let me progress onwards.</li></ul>
